"""Collect and preprocess data for leaderboard website.

Only the interactive artifacts ship. Every TabArena figure has a self-contained HTML explorer
that the site renders by default and that exports its own SVG / PDF / PNG on demand, so the
static PNGs were a second copy of what the reader already had: 80 of the 105 MB in the Space's
``data/``, and the only reason it needed Git LFS. They are still rendered into
``raw_website_artifacts/`` for paper use; they are simply not published.

BeyondArena is unaffected. It has its own copy path in
``scripts/run_generate_beyondarena_website_artifacts.py`` and ships PNGs because it has no
explorers for most of its figures.
