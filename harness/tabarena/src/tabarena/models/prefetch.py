"""Standardized pre-fetching of foundation-model weights.

Benchmarking foundation models requires their (often large, Hugging-Face-hosted) weights to be
present locally. Downloading lazily inside ``_fit`` is fine for a single run, but for a benchmark
launched across many parallel compute nodes — some without internet — the weights must be warmed
on the head node *before* the jobs are dispatched.

Each model declares *how* to fetch its own weights via ``ModelInfo.prefetch_weights`` — a zero-arg
``prefetch_weights`` callable living in the model's ``model.py`` (or, for models supported out of the
box via an external class, its ``info.py``). This module is just the thin consumer:
:func:`prefetch_weights` resolves benchmark model names to their ``ModelInfo`` and calls each one's
prefetcher. Models that declare nothing (tree / linear baselines) are skipped.
