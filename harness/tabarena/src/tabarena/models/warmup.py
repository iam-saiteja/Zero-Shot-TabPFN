"""Untimed environment warm-up for benchmarked methods.

A fresh benchmark process pays one-time environment costs that a long-lived real-world
deployment would not pay per fit: importing heavy libraries, JIT/kernel compilation
(numba, torch), and CUDA context creation. TabArena excludes these from the measured
``time_train_s`` / ``time_infer_s`` (and from fit time limits) by warming the environment
*before* the timed fit — see :attr:`~tabarena.benchmark.exec_models.base.AbstractExecModel.warmup_fn`
and ``ExperimentRunner.run_warmup``.

Fairness contract: a warm-up may only do data-independent work that is a one-time,
per-environment cost in a real deployment (imports, kernel/JIT compilation, CUDA context
initialization, hardware handles). It must never touch the task's data or carry any task-
or data-specific state into the fit.

Scope: warm-up runs once, in the job's main process, before the timed fit. It warms that
process and anything disk-backed (e.g. numba's on-disk kernel cache, which parallel-fold
workers then load instead of recompiling). It does *not* warm the in-memory state of
processes spawned later: a bagged fit with parallel (Ray) fold fitting still pays each
worker's imports / CUDA context inside the measured fit time. Where a library offers it,
prefer a warm-up that persists to disk — it is the only kind that carries over to workers.

Fit vs. predict: this is an environment warm-up, not a fit-only one — the same process runs
the timed inference, so it de-inflates ``time_infer_s`` too (and a library warm-up like
ChimeraBoost's compiles the predict kernels alongside the train ones). Data-dependent
first-call inference work on the real test data is deliberately *not* excluded — it stays in
the measured inference time. Untimed inference-side prep happens in the exec model's
``pre_predict``/``post_predict``: the AutoGluon wrappers persist the fitted model in memory
there (so measured inference excludes disk loads) and call ``prepare_for_inference()`` on
persisted model objects that declare it (see ``AGWrapper.pre_predict``).

Model classes opt in by declaring a ``warmup`` classmethod (see :func:`warmup_model_cls`);
models without one fall back to a generic torch warm-up (``AbstractTorchModel`` subclasses)
or an import-only warm-up (:data:`WARMUP_IMPORTS_BY_AG_KEY`).
