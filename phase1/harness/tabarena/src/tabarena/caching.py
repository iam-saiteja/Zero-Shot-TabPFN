"""A single place to declare every cache directory TabArena uses.

TabArena reads and writes five independent caches. Historically each was process-global
state a user had to configure by hand on *every* process — the driver and every distributed
worker — because the runner API exposed no cache parameter. :class:`CacheConfig` collapses
that into one object you declare once and :meth:`CacheConfig.apply` wherever a process needs
it; :class:`~tabarena.contexts.TabArenaContext` does the applying for you (on construction and
again inside ``run_jobs``), and the SLURM worker setup reuses the same object.

See :class:`CacheConfig` for the authoritative description of each cache and its role.

class CacheConfig:
    """Declarative configuration for every cache directory TabArena uses.

    Construct one and hand it to :class:`~tabarena.contexts.TabArenaContext`
    (``TabArenaContext(cache_config=CacheConfig(...))``); the context calls
    :meth:`apply` on construction so the driver process is configured, and again inside
    ``run_jobs`` so any worker that runs the context inherits the same locations. You can
    also call :meth:`apply` directly in a process you control (e.g. a custom distributed
    worker's entrypoint).

    A field left ``None`` is *not touched* — the existing environment variable / library
    default stays in effect. :meth:`apply` is idempotent and creates no directories (the
    underlying libraries create them lazily on first write).

    The five caches and their roles:

    openml:
        **The most important cache.** OpenML's root cache directory, set via
        ``openml.config.set_root_cache_directory`` (no environment variable is honored by
        the code). It holds the materialized datasets and their cross-validation splits, and
        — because TabArena hangs its derived artifacts off this root at runtime — also
        ``tabarena_tasks/`` (materialized task specs), ``tabarena_text_cache/`` (text-feature
        embeddings), ``tabarena_metadata_cache/`` (data-foundry reference manifests) and
        ``local/datasets/`` (local dataset payloads). Point this at a large disk; the library
        default is ``~/.cache/openml``. :meth:`apply` sets this on the (global) ``openml.config``;
        set ``scope_openml=True`` (or use :meth:`scoped_openml`) to point TabArena at it only for
        the duration of a run and restore any pre-existing ``openml.config`` location after.
    huggingface:
        The HuggingFace Hub cache for foundation-model **weights** — TabPFN / Mitra / LimiX /
        OrionMSP / SAP-RPT (and the text-embedding models) call ``hf_hub_download`` with no
        explicit ``cache_dir``, so their weights land under ``HF_HOME``. Set via the ``HF_HOME``
        environment variable; library default ``~/.cache/huggingface/hub``. This does **not**
        cover the data-foundry / BeyondArena raw *dataset* download: data-foundry passes an
        explicit ``cache_dir`` to ``snapshot_download`` (which overrides ``HF_HOME``), so those
        containers go to the separate ``data_foundry`` cache below — not here.
    data_foundry:
        The data-foundry **dataset download** cache — where BeyondArena (and any other
        data-foundry collection) downloads its raw containers from HuggingFace, into a
        per-collection ``<data_foundry>/<collection_name>/`` subdirectory, before they are
        materialized (converted) *into* the OpenML cache above. Set via the ``DATA_FOUNDRY_CACHE``
        environment variable, which data-foundry's ``resolve_cache_dir`` honors; :meth:`apply`
        exports it so every download left at ``cache_dir=None`` (the default the BeyondArena
        context uses) lands here. Library default ``~/.cache/data_foundry``. For per-call control
        instead, pass ``cache_dir=`` to the data-foundry collection / ``DataFoundryTaskMetadataSource``.
    tabarena:
        TabArena's own artifact cache — the benchmark results, baselines and leaderboard data
        downloaded by ``load_results`` and friends. Set via
        ``tabarena.loaders.set_tabarena_cache_root`` (equivalently the ``$TABARENA_CACHE``
        environment variable). Default ``~/.cache/tabarena``.
    results:
        The benchmark *run-output* cache, used as the default ``expname`` for ``run_jobs`` —
        under which the runner writes ``{expname}/data/{method}/{task}/{repeat}_{fold}/results.pkl``
        (``cache_mode`` controls resume/skip). Unlike the other three this is **not** global
        process state, so :meth:`apply` does not touch it. It is used *only* when ``run_jobs`` is
        called without an ``expname`` argument; it does not change the meaning of an explicit
        ``expname=None`` (still a throwaway temp dir). ``None`` here means "no default" (``run_jobs``
        then requires an explicit ``expname``, as before).

    Besides the locations, two flags describe *how* the config is applied by a context (the
    location fields are plain data; these are policy):

    apply_on_run:
        When ``True`` (default), the context re-applies this config at the start of each
        ``run_jobs`` / ``build_jobs(pre_materialize=True)`` — so a distributed worker that
        reconstructed the context inherits the same cache locations. Set ``False`` if the
        process is already configured and you don't want the runner touching it.
    scope_openml:
        When ``True``, the OpenML root is set only for the duration of each data operation and
        the pre-existing ``openml.config`` location is restored afterwards (via
        :meth:`scoped_openml`); the TabArena/HuggingFace caches stay applied. Use this to run
        against a dedicated OpenML
        cache without permanently changing an ambient ``openml.config`` the rest of your process
        relies on. When ``False`` (default), :meth:`apply` sets the OpenML root for the process.
