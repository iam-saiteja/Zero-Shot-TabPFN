class AbstractExecModel:
    """Base class for a benchmarked *method* (an "execution model").

    A subclass wraps some underlying model behind a small, uniform interface so the
    experiment runner can fit it, collect predictions, and record metadata the same way
    for every method. Concrete subclasses only have to implement the protected hooks
    (``_fit`` and ``_predict`` / ``_predict_proba``); everything else here is shared
    orchestration.

    Lifecycle (driven by the experiment runner):

    1. ``__init__`` — configure preprocessing and inference-shuffle behavior.
    2. ``warmup_fn`` — optional untimed environment warm-up, run before any timing starts
       (see the property).
    3. ``fit_custom`` — the end-to-end harness: optionally shuffle features, fit (while
       tracking time + memory), then predict on the test data and undo any shuffling.
    4. ``cleanup`` — release any resources (files, GPU memory, ...).

    The public ``fit`` / ``predict`` / ``predict_proba`` methods handle label and feature
    (pre)processing, then delegate to the ``_fit`` / ``_predict`` / ``_predict_proba``
    hooks. Preprocessing can be turned off via the ``preprocess_*`` flags when the
    underlying model does its own.

    Optional capabilities are advertised by the ``can_get_*`` class flags below. When a
    flag is ``True`` the runner calls the matching method (e.g. ``can_get_oof`` ->
    ``get_oof``); subclasses that flip a flag must implement the corresponding method.
    ``get_metadata`` is detected separately via ``hasattr`` by the runner.
